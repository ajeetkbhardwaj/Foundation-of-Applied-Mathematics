1. Why do I want to attend the winter school ?

I am excited about the opportunity to attend winter school because of unique chance to delve into the latest advacement
in scalable systems for big data, data science and artificial intelligence.

As a master student of Mathematics and Computing(Applied Mathematics), I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in 
handling large scale dataset and developing efficient data pipelines.

I am confident that experiance of attending winter school will be invaluable in shaping my future research direction and contributing
to the development of innovative solutions in this field.
