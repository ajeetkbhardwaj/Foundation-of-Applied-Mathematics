# From Applications to Advantages and Disadvantages



### Directed Graph(Digraph)

graphs that have directed edges between the nodes thus directed graph have directed edges i.e edges of graph that have direction indicated by arrow.

Applications

1. To find shortest paths
2. To analyse electrical circuits
3. To construct models for analysis
4. To develop project schedules
5. To represent relationships between indivisuals in a social network(Social Networks)
6. To represent links between webpages in www.(Website Design)
7. To repesent relationships between elements of a programming language like control flow of program etc(Compiler Design)
8. To analyse different models
9. To trace routes
10. To create computational graphs for automatic differentiation to compute the gradient for training of models.

Advantages

1. Every edge represents a specific direction that provides a specific route or path.
2. Route and shortest path can be traced efficiently
3. Directed graph can represent asymmetric relationships, such as one-way roads or one-way friendships, which cannot be represented by an undirected graph.
4. Directed graph has efficient algorithms, such as topological sort, which can be used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible to solve with an undirected graph.

Disadvantages

1. If the is an edge from u to v with an edge directed towards **v** we can traverse only from **u** to **v** with the help of this edge but we cannot go from v to u using this same edge.
2. Directed graph can be more complex to work with than an undirected graph, due to the added complexity of handling directed edges.
3. Directed graph may not be suitable for certain types of problems, such as those that require symmetric relationships.
4. Directed graph can be harder to visualize than an undirected graph, since the direction of the edges must be taken into account.
